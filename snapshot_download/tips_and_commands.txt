To save on space, you can extract the content of the archive on the fly (instead of download and extraction)
Another option to save on disk is to setup a temp machine with large disk space, donwload the archive, extract it and then rsync to destination node

# tar lz4
apt install -y lz4
wget -q -O - $snapshot_url | tar -I lz4 -xvf -

# zst
apt install -y zstd
curl -s $snapshot_url | zstd -d | tar xvf -

# use aria to speed up downloads, chunk the target file and download the parts in parallel
apt install -y aria2
aria2c -x 16 $snapshot_url_base

# Tips:
# usually it is the practice to save the data dir in a user dedicated to running the node, under ~/.network_name
# make sure to take a regular backup of your data dir
# use RAID if possible to help with disk corruption cases
# monitor the disk space on your node and setup alerts (Slack, PagerDuty)
# make sure you set correct permissions for the datadir
# use pruning for you node if not running an archive node
# use logrotate to save on disk space, with retention and zip archiving
